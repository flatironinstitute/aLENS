This is the setup for the dense monolayer polarity-sorting system described in **1.Gao, T., Blackwell, R., Glaser, M. A., Betterton, M. D. & Shelley, M. J. Multiscale modeling and simulation of microtubuleâ€“motor-protein assemblies. Physical Review E 92, (2015).**.

In this case the monolayer area fraction is $\sim 54\%$. This is a modest-scale case and should run well on a single multi-core machine with a few CPU cores.

**Note** We do not expect the same phenomena as described in the above paper, since the motor model here is different.
